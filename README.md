### Getting Started

You can get a local copy of the project up and running in two ways:

#### A) Using GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
This is the fastest way to get started, as it requires no local installation.

1.  Click the **`< > Code`** button on the repository's main page.
2.  Select the **`Codespaces`** tab.
3.  Click **`Create codespace on main`**.
4.  Once the Codespace loads, the project dependencies will be automatically installed. In the terminal, run `npm run dev` to start the server.

#### B) Local Development
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[your-repo-name].git
    ```
3.  **Navigate** into the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
4.  **Install** dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Run** the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
The website will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
